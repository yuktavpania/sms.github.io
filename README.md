STUDENT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM 
	• Created a GUI-based project for managing the student records and performing various CRUD operations on them.
	• Technologies used included Python language and libraries like tkinter, matplotlib, requests, random, sqlite3.
	• Live temperature & location details were displayed at the front-end using API, records were maintained and students’ 
	  performance was compared graphically.
	• Data extraction and Data visualisation was done using requests and matplotlib respectively.
